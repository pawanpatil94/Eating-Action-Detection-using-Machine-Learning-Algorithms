# Eating-Action-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

The Myo armband is a gesture recognition device worn on the forearm and manufactured by Thalmic Labs. The Myo enables the user to control technology wirelessly using various hand motions. It uses a set of electromyographic (EMG) sensors that sense electrical activity in the forearm muscles, combined with a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer to recognize gestures

<b>Problem</b>: The aim of this project is to classify eating and non-eating actions from a dataset containing sensor data of 33 individuals obtained using the sensors in MYO band (EMG and IMU sensors) which is worn on fore-arm.

• The time-series raw data is converted to meaningful data using various feature extraction techniques like RMS, variance, kurtosis, etc.<br>
• The raw data is also transformed using PCA and the two data are compared.<br>
• The meaningful data is fed to machine learning classification models like SVM, neural nets, and decision trees.<br>
• Accuracies of the order of ~95% is obtained.
